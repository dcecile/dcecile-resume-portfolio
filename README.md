_An interactive and printable webpage made with Elm_

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/dcecile/dcecile-resume-portfolio/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/dcecile/dcecile-resume-portfolio)

## Developing

1. Install [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (used for binary assets)
2. Install the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) package manager
3. Run `yarn` to install all NPM dependencies
4. [Set up your editor](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#detailed-instructions) to automatically run `elm-format` on save
5. Run `./start-dev.sh` to start the development server or run `./start-test.sh` to start running tests
6. Change a source file, and the app will reload automatically
7. Run `./check-all.sh` to run all pre-commit checks (formatting, warnings, and tests)

_Hint: to view the resume directly as a webpage (without printing), use the special `#resume` hash URL._
